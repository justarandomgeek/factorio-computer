## Machine Structure

#### Main Bus Signals

Major signals are labeled with floor concrete. In general pairs will be kept together for single-color poles, but when a pole must carry mixed paris, the left side is colored for the green wire, and the right side for red wire.

For wiring clarity, it is reccomended to remove power wires from poles and only carry power at substations.

| Pole Color | Green Wire | Red Wire |
|------------|------------|----------|
|Purple      | Memory Read Request           | Memory Read Response |
|Magenta     |                               | Memory Write         |
|Blue        | Scalar Result (`signal-grey`) |                      |
|Cyan        | R2                            | Vector Result        |
|Green       | R1                            | Scalars              |
|Yellow      | Op                            | To PC                |
|Orange      | Op Pulse                      | Status               |
|Hazard      | IO Wire                       | IO Wire              |
|FireHazard  | IO Wire Register              | IO Wire Register     |

* Scalars
	* signal-grey: R1.s1
	* signal-white: R2.s2
* To PC
	* signal-blue: next
	* signal-green: rjmp to signal-black
	* signal-red: jump to signal-black

#### Machine Blocks

* White: PC update, Instruction Fetch & Decode
* White: IO Wire Port
* Black: NixieTerm
* Black: Registers
* Red: ALU
* Blue: Scalar Pick & Insert
* Purple: Memory Controller
* Purple: RAM
* Magenta: Flow Control
* Yellow+Hazard: Debug controls

## Debug controls

The 'Stepping' button toggles between step and run modes. In step mode, the PC Update commands are cached in the debugger until released by the 'Step' button. The debugger's buffer can also be manipulated directly to adjust program flow, using the four buttons above the command display. In run mode, PC Update commands are run immediately.


## Registers

Registers store an entire circuit network frame, except `signal-black`. `signal-black` is used internally for various scalar and flag values throughout the machine, and cannot be stored in registers/memory, or expressed correctly in most mechanisms. All registers may be referred to by their number as `r0`,`r1`,`r2`,etc, and some registers may be referred to by name as listed in the table below.


| ID | Name | Purpose |
|----|------|---------|
|0|`rNull`|No Register selected|
|1-9|`r1`-`r9`| General Purpose data registers|
|10|`rRed`| IO Wire Red data since list transmitted|
|11|`rGreen`| IO Wire Green data since last transmitted|
|12|`rStat`| CPU Status register <ul><li>`signal-blue`: PC</li><li>`signal-green`: last call's return site</li></ul>|
|13|`rOp`| Current Op data|
|14|`rNixie`| NixieTerm |
|15,16|`r15`,`r16`| Wireless masts
|17|`r17`| Keyboard interface. Reads a single buffered key. Clear buffer with `signal-grey`.
|18+| `r18`-... | IO Expansion ports<br>Aditional devices may be connected to these registers


## Operations
The following signals are used to select registers and signals:

|Signal  |Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|signal-0|Op|
|signal-A| Accumulate |
|signal-R|R1|
|signal-S|S1|
|signal-T|R2|
|signal-U|S2|
|signal-V|Rd|
|signal-W|Sd|
|signal-grey|R1.S1, Imm1 in ROM, Scalar Result|
|signal-white|R2.S2, Imm2 in ROM|

If Rd is set, the selected register will be cleared as Op Pulse is triggered unless Accumulate is also set (>0), even if the current operation does not actually assign to it. The whole register will be cleared, even in scalar operations.

#### 0: Halt
Any undefined opcode will halt the machine, but Op=0 is specifically reserved for doing so.

#### 1-60: ALU Operations
The ALU performs every possible operation in parallel, and returns the requested operation's result to Scalar Result or Vector Result.

|    |Comparisons|Arithmetic|
|----|-----------|----------|
|Output|<ul><li>0: Vector</li><li>24: Scalar</li></ul>|<ul><li>48: Vector</li><li>52: Scalar</li></ul></td>
|Operator|<ul><li>1:`=`</li><li>2:`<`</li><li>3:`>`</li></ul>|<ul><li>1:`-`</li><li>2:`+`</li><li>3:`/`</li><li>4:`*`</li></ul>
|Output Mode|<ul><li>0:`?=` Input Value</li><li>3:`?1` Flags</li></ul>||
|Input Mode|<ul><li>0: Every</li><li>6: Any</li><li>12: Scalar</li><li>18: Each</li></ul>|<ul><li>0: Each</li><li>4: Scalar</li></ul>

Add one value from each cell of a column to form an instruction.

#### 70-79 Control Flow
* 70: `jump`
* 71: `call`
* 72: `rjump`
* 73: `rcall`
* 74: `branch`
* 75: `branchcall`

`call` variants store a return site in the Green signal of the status register. For `call` and `rcall` this is PC+1, for `branchcall` it is PC+4.

`jump` and `call` execute the next instruction from the address R1.s1
`rjump` and `rcall` execute the next instruction from the address PC+R1.s1
`branch` and `branchcall` compare R1.s1 to R2.s2, and makes the following jumps:

 * s1=s2 PC+1
 * s1<s2 PC+2
 * s1>s2 PC+3


#### 80: Wire
Write a packet to a two-wire network, and clear the receive registers for a response. To leave either wire untouched, select `rNull` for it. `rRed` and `rGreen` are cleared on the same frame the selected signals are transmitted. Write `rNull` to both wires to clear the receive buffer without transmitting anything.
* R1=>Red Wire
* R2=>Green Wire
* 0=>rRed,rGreen

#### 81: Write Memory
Write the contents of R1 to the memory location or memory-mapped device selected by R1.s1.
* R2 -> [R1.s1]

#### 82: Read Memory

* 82 : [R1.s1] -> Rd

## IO Devices

### NixieTerm

NixieTerm is a multi-line Alpha Nixie display. It can be accessed as an array of bit-packed strings in memory starting at `[500]`, or the lowermost row can be accessed as a `rNixie`, and shifted upward.

Any signals written in register mode will be added to the sum for the lowermost row. Writing `signal-grey` will shift all rows upward and clear the lower row. Color signals may be bit-packed along with characters.

A numeric value may also be written to a row on `signal-white` which will display in the left column of the corresponding display row.

NixieTerm supports all the characters supported by the Alpha Nixie:
* A-Z0-9 as their correspnding signals
* . as `train-stop`
* \- as `fast-splitter`

### Wireless

A cluster of wireless masts are connected on `r15` and `r16`. `r15` reads the current values on the wireless (including current transmitted signal). `r16` is a memory cell which is connected to transmit to the wireless. There are 12 masts connected, by default configured to relay all virtual signals except `signal-black`, leaving 16 slots available for custom configuration. Additional masts may be wired in as needed.
